# Several of the challenges are dynamic and require you to talk to our challenge
# servers over the network. This allows you to perform man-in-the-middle attacks
# on people trying to communicate, or directly attack a vulnerable service. To
# keep things consistent, our interactive servers always send and receive JSON
# objects.

# Such network communication can be made easy in Python with the pwntools module.
# This is not part of the Python standard library, so needs to be installed with
# pip using the command line pip install pwntools.

# For this challenge, connect to socket.cryptohack.org on port 11112. Send a JSON
# object with the key buy and value flag.
